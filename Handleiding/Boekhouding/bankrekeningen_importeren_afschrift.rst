Transacties
Importing transactions from your bank statements allows keeping track of bank account transactions and reconciling them with the ones recorded in your accounting.

Bank synchronization automates the process. However, if you do not want to use it or if your bank is not yet supported, other options exist:

Import bank transactions delivered by your bank;

Register bank transactions manually.

Grouping transactions by statement is optional.

Afschriften
A bank statement is a document provided by a bank or financial institution that lists the transactions that have occurred in a particular bank account over a specified period of time.

In Odoo Accounting, it is optional to group transactions by their related statement, but depending on your business flow, you may want to record them for control purposes.

 Belangrijk

If you want to compare the ending balances of your bank statements with the ending balances of your financial records, don’t forget to create an opening transaction to record the bank account balance as of the date you begin synchronizing or importing transactions. This is necessary to ensure the accuracy of your accounting.

To access a list of statements, go to your Accounting Dashboard, click on the vertical ellipsis (⋮) button next to the bank or cash journal you want to check, then on Statements
